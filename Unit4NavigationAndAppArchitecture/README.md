### Architecture Components

- Stages of the Activity lifecycle
  - In Android, an activity is the entry point for interacting with the user.
  - In the past, one activity would display one screen in an app.
  - With current best practices, one activity might display multiple screens by swapping them in and out as needed.
  - The activity lifecycle extends from the creation of the activity to its destruction, when the system reclaims that activity's resources. As a user navigates in and out of an activity, each activity transitions between different states in the activity lifecycle.
